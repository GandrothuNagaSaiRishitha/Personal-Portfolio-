Looked like I needed a personal portfolio to manage myself and the clutter i created last year, so, here it is!

its a basic static website marking my debut into frontend, not much btw :)

To open this file:


Have an IDE (like VS Code)


Launch the live server from the IDE after copying the HTML contents.


Also make sure to include all the pics provided for better experience.


That's it! There you go, my very own personal portfolio!



see ya around (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)
